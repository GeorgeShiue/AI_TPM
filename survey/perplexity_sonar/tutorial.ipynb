      "**Dark vessel detection** refers to the use of satellite-based technologies and advanced data processing to locate and track ships that do not broadcast their identity or position via automatic systems like AIS (Automatic Identification System) or VMS (Vessel Monitoring System). These vessels, often called \"dark vessels,\" operate without proper identification or signaling, making them difficult to monitor by conventional maritime surveillance methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The detection process typically involves:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Satellite imagery acquisition** using sensors such as optical imagers and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), which can capture images of the ocean at day, night, and under all weather conditions.\n",
      "- **Radio frequency (RF) geolocation** to detect ships emitting radar signals.\n",
      "- **Data processing and feature detection algorithms** that identify anomalies corresponding to ships in the satellite data.\n",
      "- **Cross-referencing detections with known AIS/VMS ship positions** to separate identified vessels from potentially illicit or \"dark\" vessels operating without transponders.\n",
      "- **Use of machine learning and AI** to pre-filter satellite images onboard or on ground, improving detection speed and accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "This approach allows near-real-time monitoring of illegal activities at sea, such as illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, drug trafficking, and other illicit maritime operations[1][3][4][5].\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark vessel detection is crucial for maritime domain awareness and ocean protection, especially for enforcing laws in remote regions like around the Galapagos Islands or the Indo-Pacific where enforcement is challenging[3][5]. Programs like MDA Space’s Dark Vessel Detection system integrate data from multiple satellite missions and RF sources, providing actionable intelligence to governments and conservation groups to help safeguard marine ecosystems and food security[3].\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent advancements include onboard AI systems like REMIS, which prioritize images containing ships to reduce data processing times and enhance the timeliness of detecting dark vessels[2].\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, **dark vessel detection is a satellite-enabled surveillance technique combining remote sensing, signal detection, data fusion, and AI to find ships that deliberately avoid detection by not broadcasting their locations**. This technology is vital for combating illegal maritime activities and protecting ocean resources.\n"

      "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has made several groundbreaking discoveries since its operations began, particularly in the fields of galaxy formation, exoplanets, and distant cosmic structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key discoveries include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Detection of extremely early galaxies:** JWST identified the most distant galaxy ever observed, dubbed \"MoM z14,\" which existed just 280 million years after the Big Bang. This pushes the frontier of our knowledge about the earliest stages of galaxy formation in the universe[5].\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Detailed study of galaxy evolution:** JWST has provided more detailed infrared views of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, revealing previously unseen galaxies across cosmic history including those at very high redshift, helping scientists better understand how galaxies form and evolve from just hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang to more recent times[4].\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Evidence of a giant planet near Alpha Centauri:** Observations with JWST’s MIRI instrument yielded strong evidence for a giant exoplanet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, the closest stellar system to the Sun at about 4 light-years away. Although subsequent observations have yet to confirm it definitively, this represents a major potential discovery in nearby planetary systems[2][3].\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Detection of water ice in extrasolar systems:** JWST discovered water ice in a ring of icy bodies orbiting the star HD 181327, about 156 light-years away. This provides insights into the composition of planet-forming regions around other stars[1].\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Unique engineering and observational breakthroughs:** JWST has used new technologies, such as a coronagraphic mask to block starlight and detect faint planets, and has produced detailed infrared images of intriguing galaxies like the Cartwheel Galaxy, enhancing understanding of star formation and the environments around supermassive black holes[1].\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, JWST is transforming our understanding of the early universe, the formation and evolution of galaxies, and the search for planets outside our solar system, with continuing discoveries expected as its mission progresses[1][2][3][4][5].\n",

      "**Chess rankings** are numerical ratings assigned to players based on their performance in rated games and tournaments, reflecting their relative playing strength. The most widely recognized international chess ranking system is the **FIDE Elo rating**, where players gain or lose points depending on the outcome of games against other rated players.

      "**Dark vessel detection** primarily refers to the identification of ships (\"vessels\") that are not broadcasting their location data (such as AIS transponders), making them \"dark\" or hidden in maritime monitoring contexts. This detection is often done using satellite imagery combined with advanced methods like deep learning to find these vessels and their activities, which may include illicit practices such as ship-to-ship transfers without authorization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, \"dark vessel detection\" involves using remote sensing data from satellites, then applying convolutional neural networks (a type of deep learning model) to automatically detect different types of cargo vessels and identify ship-to-ship transfers (transshipments) that do not appear in AIS data. This method helps uncover over 400 suspected illicit dark transshipment events in monitored regions, such as the Kerch Strait between Ukraine and Russia since 2022[1].\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, in maritime and surveillance contexts, **dark vessel detection means detecting vessels that deliberately hide their presence using machine learning techniques on satellite images**, enabling authorities to spot suspicious shipping activities despite the absence of onboard tracking signals. \n",
      "\n",
      "The term \"dark vessel detection\" does not seem to pertain to biological or medical vessel (e.g., blood vessel) detection based on the search results provided.\n",
